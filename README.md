# TOPSIS
TOPSIS is a method of compensatory aggregation that compares a set of alternatives by identifying weights for each criterion, normalising scores for each criterion and calculating the geometric distance between each alternative and the ideal alternative, which is the best score in each criterion.
In this projected I have implemented my own topsis package and have published it at pypi.org .
This package can be downloaded
pip install TOPSIS-KARAN-101903072
